You are escorting a troupe of seven beauties who travelled to the county fair to compete. Four of them placed in various competitions: yodeling, fiddle playing, clogging, and of course, the beauty contest. They are happy they have done so well at the competitions as they are tired of hearing about the #1 log rolling team in all of the Shudders. They are tired, too. Competing at the<br />fair is stressful.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><br />Virgil, the chaperone of the beauties, decided you would push through the night to arrive home in Timber Drop&nbsp; sometime before morning. The weather has quickly turned inhospitable - a harddriving rain pelts your cloaks,&nbsp; thunder crashes, and high winds whip through the trees on either side of the road you travel. A low mist rolls in&nbsp; across the well-traveled path you walk on. In the distance, you hear the howl of a wolf and a strange braying that causes the hair on the back of your neck to stand on end. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t right like the sound of that,&rdquo; says Virgil. So far, your trip has been uneventful. You saw a couple of wild hogs fighting on your way down, and you came across a lone traveler the day previous, but nothing dangerous has occurred. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just take this here shortcut west and maybe avoid that varmint makin&rsquo; that racket off north. We&rsquo;ll cut around behind it and make good time back to Timber Drop.&rdquo; Virgil leads you west along a much less traveled path. Overgrown with weeds in spots, the trees reach in to almost touch you as you make your way.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\"><br />&ldquo;I know this path. My daddy would take me down it to go fishing in Three Finger Lake. It meanders by the Devil&rsquo;s Traipsing Ground on its way t&rsquo; meet the main road just below The Great Grandmother.&rdquo; </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">On a DC 10 Intelligence check, PCs know the following details about the Devil&rsquo;s Traipsing Ground and the Great Grandmother:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>The Devil&rsquo;s Traipsing Ground</strong><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">&ldquo;Maw told me that clearin&rsquo; this side of Three Finger Lake was plain haunted. Nothin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t never growed there for hunned&rsquo;s a years. Just barren rocks and dirt about 100 yards &lsquo;round.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>The Great Grandmother</strong><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">&ldquo;I seen the Great Grandmother when I was knee-high to a huntin&rsquo; dog. That rock formation looks just like Tosh&rsquo;s old granny I reckon. Some say a witches&rsquo; coven carved it years ago as a place a power so to speak. I don&rsquo;t even want ta look at it I tell you.&rdquo;</span> </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">As the PCs march deeper along the path, they hear another long howl and odd braying again.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The rain drums your cloaks even harder as you slosh through the mud between the tall, leafy trees on either side of the trail. The howl you heard earlier is now even closer - louder and longer. Your hands quiver as a blood-curdling braying starts up again - sounding like a dying or deformed goat. Something humanoid in shape flies over the path in front of you - it looks like a man with great moth-like wings. A huge humanoid with the head and arms of a bear steps onto the path in front of you, wielding a wooden club. One of the beauties lets loose a blood-curdling scream.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">THE INN</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Area 1-1: The Path</strong><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">The muddy, root-laden path is closely bounded by trees on either side. The rain, fog, and darkness contribute to a -1d<br />penalty to attack rolls for human characters.</span> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong>Beastmen (1d3+3)</strong>: </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Init +1; Atk Spear/Club/Mace +1 melee (1d6), AC 12; HD 1d8; hp 5 each; MV 30&rsquo;; Act 1d20; SV Fort<br />+1, Ref +1, Will -1, AL C.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><br />These beastmen were created in the tar pits around the nowabandoned town of Buncombe Bluff. Five years ago, a<br />conjure-man who served Nengal the Wild One performed a horrible ritual over the tar pits trying to create a tar golem. Instead, the tar turned some of the townspeople who worked the pits into mutated beastmen. They now serve Nengal too. They have varied forms transformed from animals from the appalachians. Roll a D6 to determine the appearance of a given beastman:</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table class=\"NormalTable\" style=\"width: 99.1453%; height: 221px;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 8.81944%;\"><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\">1d6<br /></span></strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.4622%;\"><strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Result (appearance of Beastman)<br /></span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 34px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 8.81944%; height: 34px;\" width=\"36\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">1 </span></td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.4622%; height: 34px;\" width=\"381\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A beastman with moth wings and red, glowing eyes.

If they take someone down, they begin to gorge on human flesh. After the party has defeated the band of beastmen, they hear another howl in the dark as more fog rolls in.<br /></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get a move on!&rdquo; Virgil shouts over the din of the pouring rain. &ldquo;I seen a light up &lsquo;round that bend!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Virgil will lead the party if they aren&rsquo;t taking the lead. Just around the bend, a clearing opens up on either side of the<br />trail. </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">A large wooden shack is set back about 50 feet off the trail to the left. Lights burn in the two small front windows, and a lantern hangs over the heavy wooden door on the front of the house. Dark green kudzu vines grow from the<br />dirt all the way to the tin roof of the hovel. Rain patters on the tin, creating an eerie song that promises a dry night on a warm pallet.</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The shack is extremely large - 40 feet x 40 feet. Having a wooden door and a tin roof makes it very high class for the Shudder Mountains.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br />Across the path sits a much larger clearing. It is tough to make out in the rainy gloom.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br />If the PCs approach the other clearing: </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The clearing is covered in tall grass except for a rocky circle about 100 feet in diameter centered on some low stonework. It looks like old stone foundation work, a very rare thing in the Shudder Mountains. In the center of the stonework looks to be the remains of a burn pile.</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If the PCs search the pile, have them roll a find traps check (DC 10). If they succeed, they see: </span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Under the burn pile, the ground is cracked, as if it were dried out completely from the fire.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If the PCs approach the house:</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">You walk up the path from the road toward the red painted wooden door of the shack. Virgil looks back at you. &ldquo;This place looks as promising as any for a place to bed down. Real sorry I got y&rsquo;all into this pickle!&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br />Knocking on the door yields a response from a pleasant male voice. &ldquo;Hello, who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">If the PCs identify themselves, the innkeeper will let them in.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">As the door opens, the warmth of the shack blows out the large door and seeps into your bones. The enticing smell of meat stew cooking wafts out past the curious dweller who opened the door. &ldquo;Welcome, welcome! Get yourselves in here out of the rain and cold.&rdquo; He gestures to a coarse wire welcome mat on the wooden floorboards at your feet. &ldquo;Once you&rsquo;ve wiped your feet, come have a rest at the table and eat some supper. All are welcome at The Handsome Bee&rdquo;.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br />Looking around the room, it clearly doesn&rsquo;t take up the whole shack. The walls are made of rough barnwood. The floor is sanded wood. A comfortable, homecraft dining table is set with bowls and spoons, surrounded by long wooden benches. A huge hearth takes up another side of the room, a roaring fire staving off the night&rsquo;s cold and dampness. Before the hearth, several pallets and a long, stuffed couch are situated around a large black bear rug. A Halfling reclines on the couch with a woman who looks to be in her early 40s; before the hearth, a male Elf sings a murder ballad beautifully. In the back wall and right-side wall are thin wooden doors.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br />The dweller who let you in is tall, taller than most Shudfolk. He wears a long frock coat over a flannel shirt and corduroy pants. He wears shoes made from deer or moose hide. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the keeper of this inn, named Lester Otis. Been keeping this inn in these parts for years.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Roll a Luck check for each player. Any who succeed notice the man&rsquo;s eyes glint in the candlelight. Any player who rolls</span> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">below a 5 notices his ring fingers are longer than the rest of his fingers.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd, I ain&rsquo;t never seen this inn before, and I&rsquo;ve been by this Devil&rsquo;s Traipsing Ground once afore in my long life,&rdquo; says Virgil. </span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">&ldquo;Been here near to 5 years&rdquo; says Lester. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s might sit you down and get you some supper.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br />A shapely woman of around 30 years enters the room from the right-side door. She wears a white apron over a scarlet dress cut just in the right places. She bears a big soup pot - at least 5 gallons - on a tray. The stew in the pot smells delicious.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br />&ldquo;Got here some venison stew with plenty of bread for the lot of y&rsquo;all!&rdquo; says the woman in a sing-song voice. Lester emerges from the kitchen with two huge loaves of warm bread. The food is placed on the table.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">&ldquo;What are y&rsquo;all charging for this fine feast you present so thoughtfully to weary travelers wore out from the weather and the walkin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asks Virgil.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br />&ldquo;Oh, a pittance, my friend, a pittance. Five copper per night will see each tired traveler rightly fed, roomed, and bedded with the finest food and furnishings this side of Pilot Mountain.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br />Virgil reaches into the purse he keeps tied tightly around his rotund waist - pulling out several coins. &ldquo;This should cover our lot for the evening, plus a little more for your gracious hospitality.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br />Lester quickly deposits the coins in an interior pocket of his coat. The other travelers are delivered bowls and bread in their current seats - leaving the large dining room table for your party.</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The party can socialize with anyone present. Here are short descriptions/bios for each person present in the room.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Delilah, the mistress of the house: </span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Short, with long red hair, Delilah is a handsome 30-year-old woman in a scarlet dress. Her blue eyes dart around the table as she sips her stew from a large spoon and drinks hill wine out of a wooden cup. She pours wine or more stew for anyone present. She will only say that she grew up around Bacon Holler, just a short jog from the Devil&rsquo;s Traipsing Ground. </span></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">She is actually an aspiring Witch. She is working with the<br />Shonokins to feed the Gardinel beneath the Devil&rsquo;s Traipsing Ground.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>Delilah:</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Init -2; Atk claw -2 melee (1d4-1) or curse (DC 16 Will save; see below) or spell; AC 9; HD 3d6; MV 20&rsquo;; Act 1d20; curse, spellcasting (+4 spell check); SV Fort +4, Ref +0, Will +8; AL C.

He is tall and lithe, but only differs from humans in two ways; he has cat eyes and his ring finger is longer than his other fingers. He can cast spells and possesses a magic pair of spoons. The spoons will force anyone who hears them to begin dancing.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br />The Shonokins&rsquo; goal is always the elimination of all Humans and demi-human races. Their current goal is to feed the Gardinel, hoping to regrow the first floor above ground, so they can move somewhere else and let the Gardinel eat people unattended.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br />The Shonokins have sharp nails and cannot tolerate the presence of one of their dead. If a dead Shonokin is in view,any other Shonokin will flee. </span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Lester</strong>: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Init +2; Atk claw +2 melee (1d4+1) or offensive spell (1d6 damage); AC 12; HD 3d12; hp 18; MV 30&rsquo;; Act 2d20; SP spoons; SV Fort +3, Ref +1, Will +3; AL C.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Spoons of Dancing Death:</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Lester&rsquo;s spoons look like a pair of brass spoons. When he slaps them on his knee or side, everyone in earshot must make a DC 12 Will save or begin clogging for 3 rounds. On the second round, they can make a Will save again vs. a DC 10, or DC 8 on the third round. Anyone clogging is unable to take any actions. If a player actually stands up and clogs on the table, he will save automatically next round.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Gordy, the Halfling</strong>: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Gordy is a road dog shoe salesman. He is one of the few Halflings seen wearing shoes. He sells &ldquo;genuine authentic gator skin boots&rdquo; that he claims to tan and cobble himself. He tries to work shoe sales into every conversation.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Elvira, the Priestess of Shul:</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Elvira is a middle-aged woman with a large black hairdo. She venerates and evangelizes Shul, the moon god, patron god of literacy. She wears a black robe with a wool hat. She is just passing through the Shudder Mountains from the Low Country, and her message of literacy is not popular here.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Zaos, the Elf Bard</strong>: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Zaos is traveling the Shudder Mountains gathering stories. He has lived a long life in the area and is working on collecting all the stories told in the oral tradition locally into a Grimm&rsquo;s Fairy Tales-type book. He wears a long wool jacket over a white long sleeve shirt and wool breeches. </span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Delilah comes back out of the kitchen with some fresh stew. </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">&ldquo;Well now y&rsquo;all will wanna have some of this stew I made for you. It&rsquo;ll restore your vitality and really put some meat on them bones.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The PCs can talk with the NPCs for a while over dinner. Delilah will bring out pots of hill wine as part of dinner, which will flow freely. After dinner, Lester will show the PCs to their rooms.</span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">&ldquo;These are your rooms, folks. Finest rooms you will find this side of the Yancy River.&rdquo; </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Each room has a pile of pillows on one side, a pile of heavy wool blankets on the other, and heavy rugs covering the floor. </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">&ldquo;If y&rsquo;all need anything just give a shout. Delilah and I will be just down the hall.&rdquo; </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Allow the PCs to organize themselves how they wish; seven people will fit in a room. As the PCs settle in, they find that</span> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">the room is warm, though they can hear the wind howling and the rain pelting the side and roof of the house.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br />After a couple of hours, allow the PCs to roll Fort saves against DC 12. Anyone who fails is affected by the drugs Delilah put in the wine and will not wake up easily. The room with fewer PCs in it (more beauties) has a visitor: a Shonokin pops up through a trapdoor in the floor under one of the rugs. He pulls the sedated beauties down through the trapdoor and puts them in the basement for the Gardinel to eat. Allow PCs who didn&rsquo;t fall for the sedation to roll a DC 10 Intelligence check to notice the Shonokin stealing slumbering beauties down the trapdoor.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">THE BASEMENT</span></span></h1>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Area 2-1: The Stairs Down</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">The ladder down from the bedroom leads to a dank basement with clay floors, wood slat walls, and a timber ceiling. There is no lighting. Dripping water can be heard, and the air smells like soggy bread. Light is visible under the crack of a door at the end of the hall. The door is not locked. It is an old pine door with just a latch, opening inward.</span></span></p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Area 2-2: The Storeroom</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">This is a large room with a clay floor. Wood beams hold up the ceiling overhead. The floor is piled high with crates and barrels. In among the crates are a stack of old chairs and several nasty old brooms. A candle burns in a wall sconce next to some stairs leading upward. A hall leads away from the room into darkness.&nbsp; </span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle3\">This room is normally the storeroom for the inn. After a moment of looking around, a Shonokin stumbles on the PCs from down the hall.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A tall man, rather resembling Lester, but not he, stumbles onto you from down the hall. &ldquo;Say, what are y&rsquo;all doing down here?&rdquo; says the man.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">PCs may notice he has the same cat&rsquo;s eyes and long ring fingers as Lester.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe y&rsquo;all belong down here. Let&rsquo;s go back upstairs,&rdquo; he says.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">If the PCs disagree or attack, the man fights back:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">&ldquo;Well now, I hoped it wouldn&rsquo;t come to this.&rdquo;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The man reaches inside his long frock coat and takes out a large frog. He hangs it by one leg from his hand and chants:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Dance, dance yonder chair,<br />Prepare to slay intruders there,<br />Obey my command dusty broom,<br />Kill the trespassers in this room!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The frog lets out a loud CROOOOAKK as the chairs and brooms animate. The brooms stand up on their bristles like many legs, swinging their ends like staffs. The chairs splay out their backs like spines, charging toward you with the intention of impaling.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Attack Chair (4)</strong>: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Init -1; Atk stab +1 melee (1d4); AC 12; HD 1d8; hp 5; MV 20&rsquo;, Act 1d20; SV Fort +2, Ref +1, Will +0; AL N.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /></span><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Broom Brawler (3):</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Init 0; Atk slam +2 melee (1d3); AC 12; HD 1d8; hp 5; MV 20&rsquo;, Act 1d20; SV Fort +2, Ref +1, Will +0; AL N.</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br />Brooms can split into two smaller brooms when slain:</span></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><strong><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><br /></span></strong><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Small Broom Brawler (3):</strong> </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Init 0; Atk slam +1 melee (1d3-1); AC 12; HD 1d8; hp 4; MV 20&rsquo;, Act 1d20; SV Fort +2, Ref +1, Will +0; AL N.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Area 2-3: Hill Wine Cellar</span></span></h2>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The walls of this room are lined with barrels, tapped with spigots. The floor is sticky with old hill wine and stump whiskey. The smell of old wine wafts over from the barrels when entering from the hall. The sound of quiet slurping is<br />barely heard over the drip-drip-drip of the wine. </span></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This room is largely empty, but footprints are noticeable in the dust if PCs look toward the floor. A large number of rats have feasted on the old wine and whiskey and have been tainted by the drugs put in them. The effect of the drugs varies depending on the rat (or person), but the bite of the rats causes extra damage from the effects of the drugs. The rats only attack if the party gets close to them, under the wine barrels against the wall.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle2\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><strong>Rat, Giant (5)</strong>: </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Init +2; Atk bite +1 melee (1d4 plus disease); AC 13; HD 1d6; hp 3; MV 30&rsquo; or climb 20&rsquo;; Act 1d20; SP<br />disease (DC 7 Fort save or additional 1d3 damage); SV Fort +4, Ref +2, Will -1; AL N.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Area 2-4: Root Cellar</h2>\n<p>Crates of old food are stacked high on the dirt floor of this old root cellar. The flickering torch casts eerie shadows across the old quilts hanging from the wall. A clock hangs on the wall with different symbols and more than 12 hours. One of the hands spins wildly above a small closed door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the PCs approach the clock, it clangs loudly as the hands pass each other.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The door on the clock face opens, and a small wooden bird slides out on a wood dowel, opening its beak. A purple cloud shoots out of the beak in a cone 5 feet out from the bird. The cloud is a mixture of aging mist. Any PCs affected by the cloud must roll a DC 13 Fort save or age 3d3 years. They gain any side effects of aging, like balding, wrinkles, gray hair, arthritis, etc.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Area 2-5: The Bear&rsquo;s Lair</h2>\n<p>This room is piled high with old junk. Ratty blankets, an old bear rug, and threadbare clothing are piled up in the far corner. The smell of rot pervades this dead-end room. Old blankets hang from the walls where they look like they were being cleaned before being forgotten.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the PCs investigate the pile of junk, they hear:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From behind one of the blankets over your shoulder, you hear the words &ldquo;Rise, Mortimer!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A frog croaks, and the old bear rug on the center of the pile begins to stand up before your very eyes. The flat legs step down to support the hide while the head, loaded with sharp teeth, wobbles around. A dull roar echoes through the cavern as the bear rug monster leaps down.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Bear Rug Monster:</strong> Init +1; Atk bite +2 melee (1d6), swipe +2 melee (1d4); AC 13; HD 3d10+3; hp 20; MV 30&rsquo; or climb 20&rsquo;; Act 3d20; SP bear hug; SV Fort +4, Ref +2, Will -1; AL N.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the bear rug monster hits with 2 of its 3 attacks, it can bear hug. It wraps the target like a towel and starts to squeeze. The target takes an additional 1d4 damage. They can try to shake off the rug next turn with a DC 10 Strength or Agility check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the PCs investigate the voice that cast the rug-animating spell, they find a secret door leading onward behind the blanket. It can be found by an Elf (who is entitled to a check automatically while passing it) or anyone looking for it carefully with a DC 8 Intelligence check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Area 2-6: Preparations</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The floor squelches under foot. The walls look like tan mud, but they hold together. A disgusting smell, like bile, wafts back from the hall ahead. A large wooden table is laid out with clothing and jewelry. Delilah stands next to the table, an ugly look on her face. She points a wooden spoon at you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;all really do not belong down here. You should have stayed sleeping in your room until we came to get you for the Gardinel.&rdquo; She shakes her spoon, and a large black canine erupts from the floor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Delilah:</strong> Init -2; Atk claw -2 melee (1d4-1) or curse (DC 16 Will save; see below) or spell; AC 9; HD 3d6; hp 16; MV 20&rsquo;; Act 1d20; SP curse, spellcasting (+4 spell check); SV Fort +4, Ref +0, Will +8; AL C.

Rabies causes 1 point of Intelligence loss every 24 hours and 1d3 damage. Eventually the sufferer goes mad and starts attacking other party members, also inflicting rabies with his bite.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Area 2-7: The Stomach</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The hallway opens up into a massive room. The walls are made of the same tan mud the last room was made of. On the walls you can see fleshy person-sized lumps. Lester, and the man who resembles Lester, are turned away from you on the far side of the room. You see them slide the body of one of the beauties into a gap in the wall, which closes around the beauty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the PCs look up, read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ceiling converges around a tiny opening. A small amount of light filters through the hole onto the floor in the center of the room.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As soon as the PCs enter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lester and his partner slowly turn toward you. Their cat eyes focus on you in unison. &ldquo;So, you have come to be fed to the Gardinel!&rdquo; growls Lester. &ldquo;You could have rested and slowly drifted off like the rest of your companions,&rdquo; says his partner.

When he slaps them on his knee or side, everyone in earshot must make a DC 12 Will save or begin clogging for 3 rounds.

They could climb up out of the sphincter in the ceiling. They could go back out the way they came. They can burn the Gardinel and the inn to the ground or take it over as a place to live. Picking up the brass spoons and Delilah&rsquo;s wand will grant them powerful magic items.</p>\n<p><br /><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Howlin&rsquo; Wooden Spoon: </strong>This magic wooden stirring spoon allows a Wizard or Elf to cast summon animal at +1d.
